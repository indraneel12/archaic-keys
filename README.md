# Archaic Keys: Unlocking Language Diversity

In a world increasingly reliant on digital communication, ensuring inclusive linguistic support is paramount. Our project endeavors to bridge this gap by developing robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) models tailored specifically for underrepresented languages. Focused initially on Malayalam and Nepali, our project extends beyond mere academic pursuits; it responds to a pressing need for tools accommodating archaic characters, ligatures, and other linguistic nuances often overlooked by existing platforms.
